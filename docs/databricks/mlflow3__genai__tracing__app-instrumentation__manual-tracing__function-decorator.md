# Function decorators

The [`@mlflow.trace`](<https://mlflow.org/docs/latest/api_reference/python_api/mlflow.html#mlflow.trace>) decorator allows you to create a span for any function. Function decorators provide the simplest path to adding tracing with minimal code changes.

  * MLflow detects the parent-child relationships between functions, making it compatible with auto-tracing integrations.
  * Captures exceptions during function execution and records them as span events.
  * Automatically logs the function's name, inputs, outputs, and execution time.
  * Can be used alongside auto-tracing features.



## Prerequisitesâ

  * MLflow 3
  * MLflow 2.x



This page requires the following packages:

  * `mlflow[databricks]` 3.1 and above: Core MLflow functionality with GenAI features and Databricks connectivity.
  * `openai` 1.0.0 and above: (Optional) Only if your custom code interacts with OpenAI; replace with other SDKs if needed.



Install the basic requirements:

Python
    
    
    %pip install --upgrade "mlflow[databricks]>=3.1"  
    # %pip install --upgrade openai>=1.0.0 # Install if needed  
    

This guide requires the following packages:

  * `mlflow[databricks]` 2.15.0 and above: Core MLflow functionality with Databricks connectivity.
  * `openai` 1.0.0 and above. (Optional) Only if your custom code interacts with OpenAI.



MLflow version

Databricks strongly recommends installing MLflow 3.1 or newer if using `mlflow[databricks]`.

Install the basic requirements:

Python
    
    
    %pip install --upgrade "mlflow[databricks]>=2.15.0,<3.0.0"  
    # pip install --upgrade openai>=1.0.0 # Install if needed  
    

## Basic exampleâ

The following code is a minimum example of using the decorator for tracing Python functions.

Decorator Order

To ensure complete observability, the [`@mlflow.trace`](<https://mlflow.org/docs/latest/api_reference/python_api/mlflow.html#mlflow.trace>) decorator should generally be the outermost one if using multiple decorators. See Using @mlflow.trace with Other Decorators for a detailed explanation and examples.

Python
    
    
    import mlflow  
      
      
    @mlflow.trace(span_type="func", attributes={"key": "value"})  
    def add_1(x):  
        return x + 1  
      
      
    @mlflow.trace(span_type="func", attributes={"key1": "value1"})  
    def minus_1(x):  
        return x - 1  
      
      
    @mlflow.trace(name="Trace Test")  
    def trace_test(x):  
        step1 = add_1(x)  
        return minus_1(step1)  
      
      
    trace_test(4)  
    

note

When a trace contains multiple spans with same name, MLflow appends an auto-incrementing suffix to them, such as `_1`, `_2`.

## Customize spansâ

The [`@mlflow.trace`](<https://mlflow.org/docs/latest/api_reference/python_api/mlflow.html#mlflow.trace>) decorator accepts following arguments to customize the span to be created:

  * `name` parameter to override the span name from the default (the name of decorated function)
  * `span_type` parameter to set the type of span. Set either one of built-in [Span Types](</aws/en/mlflow3/genai/tracing/span-concepts#span-types>) or a string.
  * `attributes` parameter to add custom attributes to the span.



Decorator Order

When combining [`@mlflow.trace`](<https://mlflow.org/docs/latest/api_reference/python_api/mlflow.html#mlflow.trace>) with other decorators (for example from web frameworks), it's crucial for it to be the outermost. For a clear example of correct vs. incorrect ordering, please refer to Using @mlflow.trace with Other Decorators.

Python
    
    
    @mlflow.trace(  
        name="call-local-llm", span_type=SpanType.LLM, attributes={"model": "gpt-4o-mini"}  
    )  
    def invoke(prompt: str):  
        return client.invoke(  
            messages=[{"role": "user", "content": prompt}], model="gpt-4o-mini"  
        )  
    

Alternatively, you can update an active or live span dynamically inside the function by using [`mlflow.get_current_active_span`](<https://mlflow.org/docs/latest/api_reference/python_api/mlflow.html#mlflow.get_current_active_span>) API.

Python
    
    
    @mlflow.trace(span_type=SpanType.LLM)  
    def invoke(prompt: str):  
        model_id = "gpt-4o-mini"  
        # Get the current span (created by the @mlflow.trace decorator)  
        span = mlflow.get_current_active_span()  
        # Set the attribute to the span  
        span.set_attributes({"model": model_id})  
        return client.invoke(messages=[{"role": "user", "content": prompt}], model=model_id)  
    

See [Span tracing with context managers](</aws/en/mlflow3/genai/tracing/app-instrumentation/manual-tracing/span-tracing>) for more examples of editing [`LiveSpan`](<https://mlflow.org/docs/latest/api_reference/python_api/mlflow.entities.html#mlflow.entities.LiveSpan>) objects.

##  Use `@mlflow.trace` with other decoratorsâ

When applying multiple decorators to a single function, it's crucial to place [`@mlflow.trace`](<https://mlflow.org/docs/latest/api_reference/python_api/mlflow.html#mlflow.trace>) as the **outermost** decorator (the one at the very top). This ensures that MLflow can capture the entire execution of the function, including the behavior of any inner decorators.

If [`@mlflow.trace`](<https://mlflow.org/docs/latest/api_reference/python_api/mlflow.html#mlflow.trace>) is not the outermost decorator, its visibility into the function's execution may be limited or incorrect, potentially leading to incomplete traces or misrepresentation of the function's inputs, outputs, and execution time.

Consider the following conceptual example:

Python
    
    
    import mlflow  
    import functools  
    import time  
      
    # A hypothetical additional decorator  
    def simple_timing_decorator(func):  
        @functools.wraps(func)  
        def wrapper(*args, **kwargs):  
            start_time = time.time()  
            result = func(*args, **kwargs)  
            end_time = time.time()  
            print(f"{func.__name__} executed in {end_time - start_time:.4f} seconds by simple_timing_decorator.")  
            return result  
        return wrapper  
      
    # Correct order: @mlflow.trace is outermost  
    @mlflow.trace(name="my_decorated_function_correct_order")  
    @simple_timing_decorator  
    # @another_framework_decorator # e.g., @app.route("/mypath") from Flask  
    def my_complex_function(x, y):  
        # Function logic here  
        time.sleep(0.1) # Simulate work  
        return x + y  
      
    # Incorrect order: @mlflow.trace is NOT outermost  
    @simple_timing_decorator  
    @mlflow.trace(name="my_decorated_function_incorrect_order")  
    # @another_framework_decorator  
    def my_other_complex_function(x, y):  
        time.sleep(0.1)  
        return x * y  
      
    # Example calls  
    if __name__ == "__main__":  
        print("Calling function with correct decorator order:")  
        my_complex_function(5, 3)  
      
        print("\nCalling function with incorrect decorator order:")  
        my_other_complex_function(5, 3)  
    

In the `my_complex_function` example (correct order), [`@mlflow.trace`](<https://mlflow.org/docs/latest/api_reference/python_api/mlflow.html#mlflow.trace>) will capture the full execution, including the time added by `simple_timing_decorator`. In `my_other_complex_function` (incorrect order), the trace captured by MLflow might not accurately reflect the total execution time or could miss modifications to inputs/outputs made by `simple_timing_decorator` before [`@mlflow.trace`](<https://mlflow.org/docs/latest/api_reference/python_api/mlflow.html#mlflow.trace>) sees them.

## Add trace tagsâ

Tags can be added to traces to provide additional metadata at the trace level. There are a few different ways to set tags on a trace. Please refer to the [attach custom tags guide](</aws/en/mlflow3/genai/tracing/attach-tags/>) for the other methods.

Python
    
    
    @mlflow.trace  
    def my_func(x):  
        mlflow.update_current_trace(tags={"fruit": "apple"})  
        return x + 1  
    

## Customize request and response previews in the UIâ

The Traces tab in the MLflow UI displays a list of traces, and the `Request` and `Response` columns show a preview of the end-to-end input and output of each trace. This allows you to quickly understand what each trace represents.

By default, these previews are truncated to a fixed number of characters. However, you can customize what's shown in these columns by using the `request_preview` and `response_preview` parameters within the `mlflow.update_current_trace()` function. This is particularly useful for complex inputs or outputs where the default truncation might not show the most relevant information.

Below is an example of setting a custom request preview for a trace that processes a long document and user instructions, aiming to render the most relevant information in the UI's `Request` column:

Python
    
    
    import mlflow  
      
    @mlflow.trace(name="Summarization Pipeline")  
    def summarize_document(document_content: str, user_instructions: str):  
        # Construct a custom preview for the request column  
        # For example, show beginning of document and user instructions  
        request_p = f"Doc: {document_content[:30]}... Instr: {user_instructions[:30]}..."  
        mlflow.update_current_trace(request_preview=request_p)  
      
        # Simulate LLM call  
        # messages = [  
        #     {"role": "system", "content": "Summarize the following document based on user instructions."},  
        #     {"role": "user", "content": f"Document: {document_content}\nInstructions: {user_instructions}"}  
        # ]  
        # completion = client.chat.completions.create(model="gpt-4o-mini", messages=messages)  
        # summary = completion.choices[0].message.content  
        summary = f"Summary of document starting with '{document_content[:20]}...' based on '{user_instructions}'"  
      
        # Customize the response preview  
        response_p = f"Summary: {summary[:50]}..."  
        mlflow.update_current_trace(response_preview=response_p)  
      
        return summary  
      
    # Example Call  
    long_document = "This is a very long document that contains many details about various topics..." * 10  
    instructions = "Focus on the key takeaways regarding topic X."  
    summary_result = summarize_document(long_document, instructions)  
    # print(summary_result)  
    

By setting `request_preview` and `response_preview` on the trace (typically the root span), you control how the overall interaction is summarized in the main trace list view, making it easier to identify and understand traces at a glance.

## Automatic exception handlingâ

If an `Exception` is raised during processing of a trace-instrumented operation, an indication will be shown within the UI that the invocation was not successful and a partial capture of data will be available to aid in debugging. Additionally, details about the Exception that was raised will be included within `Events` of the partially completed span, further aiding the identification of where issues are occurring within your code.

## Combine with auto-tracingâ

Manual tracing seamlessly integrates with MLflow's auto-tracing capabilities. See [Combine manual and automatic tracing](</aws/en/mlflow3/genai/tracing/app-instrumentation/automatic#combine-manual-automatic>).

## Complex workflow tracingâ

For complex workflows with multiple steps, use nested spans to capture detailed execution flow:

Python
    
    
    @mlflow.trace(name="data_pipeline")  
    def process_data_pipeline(data_source: str):  
        # Extract phase  
        with mlflow.start_span(name="extract") as extract_span:  
            raw_data = extract_from_source(data_source)  
            extract_span.set_outputs({"record_count": len(raw_data)})  
      
        # Transform phase  
        with mlflow.start_span(name="transform") as transform_span:  
            transformed = apply_transformations(raw_data)  
            transform_span.set_outputs({"transformed_count": len(transformed)})  
      
        # Load phase  
        with mlflow.start_span(name="load") as load_span:  
            result = load_to_destination(transformed)  
            load_span.set_outputs({"status": "success"})  
      
        return result  
    

## Multi-threadingâ

MLflow Tracing is thread-safe, traces are isolated by default per thread. But you can also create a trace that spans multiple threads with a few additional steps.

MLflow uses Python's built-in [ContextVar](<https://docs.python.org/3/library/contextvars.html>) mechanism to ensure thread safety, which is not propagated across threads by default. Therefore, you need to manually copy the context from the main thread to the worker thread, as shown in the example below.

Python
    
    
    import contextvars  
    from concurrent.futures import ThreadPoolExecutor, as_completed  
    import mlflow  
    from mlflow.entities import SpanType  
    import openai  
      
    client = openai.OpenAI()  
      
    # Enable MLflow Tracing for OpenAI  
    mlflow.openai.autolog()  
      
      
    @mlflow.trace  
    def worker(question: str) -> str:  
        messages = [  
            {"role": "system", "content": "You are a helpful assistant."},  
            {"role": "user", "content": question},  
        ]  
        response = client.chat.completions.create(  
            model="gpt-4o-mini",  
            messages=messages,  
            temperature=0.1,  
            max_tokens=100,  
        )  
        return response.choices[0].message.content  
      
      
    @mlflow.trace  
    def main(questions: list[str]) -> list[str]:  
        results = []  
        # Almost same as how you would use ThreadPoolExecutor, but two additional steps  
        #  1. Copy the context in the main thread using copy_context()  
        #  2. Use ctx.run() to run the worker in the copied context  
        with ThreadPoolExecutor(max_workers=2) as executor:  
            futures = []  
            for question in questions:  
                ctx = contextvars.copy_context()  
                futures.append(executor.submit(ctx.run, worker, question))  
            for future in as_completed(futures):  
                results.append(future.result())  
        return results  
      
      
    questions = [  
        "What is the capital of France?",  
        "What is the capital of Germany?",  
    ]  
      
    main(questions)  
    

tip

In contrast, `ContextVar` is copied to **async** tasks by default. Therefore, you don't need to manually copy the context when using `asyncio`, which might be an easier way to handle concurrent I/O-bound tasks in Python with MLflow Tracing.

## Streaming outputsâ

The [`@mlflow.trace`](<https://mlflow.org/docs/latest/api_reference/python_api/mlflow.html#mlflow.trace>) decorator can be used to trace functions that return a generator or an iterator, since MLflow 2.20.2.

Python
    
    
    @mlflow.trace  
    def stream_data():  
        for i in range(5):  
            yield i  
    

The above example will generate a trace with a single span for the `stream_data` function. By default, MLflow will capture all elements yielded by the generator as a list in the span's output. In the example above, the output of the span will be `[0, 1, 2, 3, 4]`.

note

A span for a stream function will start when the returned iterator starts to be **consumed** , and will end when the iterator is exhausted, or an exception is raised during the iteration.

### Using output reducersâ

If you want to aggregate the elements to be a single span output, you can use the `output_reducer` parameter to specify a custom function to aggregate the elements. The custom function should take a list of yielded elements as inputs.

Python
    
    
    from typing import List, Any  
      
    @mlflow.trace(output_reducer=lambda x: ",".join(x))  
    def stream_data():  
        for c in "hello":  
            yield c  
    

In the example above, the output of the span will be `"h,e,l,l,o"`. The raw chunks can still be found in the `Events` tab of the span in the MLflow Trace UI, allowing you to inspect individual yielded values when debugging.

### Common output reducer patternsâ

Here are some common patterns for implementing output reducers:

#### Token aggregationâ

Python
    
    
    from typing import List, Dict, Any  
      
    def aggregate_tokens(chunks: List[str]) -> str:  
        """Concatenate streaming tokens into complete text"""  
        return "".join(chunks)  
      
    @mlflow.trace(output_reducer=aggregate_tokens)  
    def stream_text():  
        for word in ["Hello", " ", "World", "!"]:  
            yield word  
    

#### Metrics aggregationâ

Python
    
    
    def aggregate_metrics(chunks: List[Dict[str, Any]]) -> Dict[str, Any]:  
        """Aggregate streaming metrics into summary statistics"""  
        values = [c["value"] for c in chunks if "value" in c]  
        return {  
            "count": len(values),  
            "sum": sum(values),  
            "average": sum(values) / len(values) if values else 0,  
            "max": max(values) if values else None,  
            "min": min(values) if values else None  
        }  
      
    @mlflow.trace(output_reducer=aggregate_metrics)  
    def stream_metrics():  
        for i in range(10):  
            yield {"value": i * 2, "timestamp": time.time()}  
    

#### Error collectionâ

Python
    
    
    def collect_results_and_errors(chunks: List[Dict[str, Any]]) -> Dict[str, Any]:  
        """Separate successful results from errors"""  
        results = []  
        errors = []  
      
        for chunk in chunks:  
            if chunk.get("error"):  
                errors.append(chunk["error"])  
            else:  
                results.append(chunk.get("data"))  
      
        return {  
            "results": results,  
            "errors": errors,  
            "success_rate": len(results) / len(chunks) if chunks else 0,  
            "has_errors": len(errors) > 0  
        }  
    

## Advanced example: OpenAI streamingâ

The following is an advanced example that uses the `output_reducer` to consolidate ChatCompletionChunk output from an OpenAI LLM into a single message object.

tip

We recommend using the [auto-tracing for OpenAI](</aws/en/mlflow3/genai/tracing/integrations/openai>) for production use cases, which handles this automatically. The example below is for demonstration purposes.

Python
    
    
    import mlflow  
    import openai  
    from openai.types.chat import *  
    from typing import Optional  
      
      
    def aggregate_chunks(outputs: list[ChatCompletionChunk]) -> Optional[ChatCompletion]:  
        """Consolidate ChatCompletionChunks to a single ChatCompletion"""  
        if not outputs:  
            return None  
      
        first_chunk = outputs[0]  
        delta = first_chunk.choices[0].delta  
        message = ChatCompletionMessage(  
            role=delta.role, content=delta.content, tool_calls=delta.tool_calls or []  
        )  
        finish_reason = first_chunk.choices[0].finish_reason  
        for chunk in outputs[1:]:  
            delta = chunk.choices[0].delta  
            message.content += delta.content or ""  
            message.tool_calls += delta.tool_calls or []  
            finish_reason = finish_reason or chunk.choices[0].finish_reason  
      
        base = ChatCompletion(  
            id=first_chunk.id,  
            choices=[Choice(index=0, message=message, finish_reason=finish_reason)],  
            created=first_chunk.created,  
            model=first_chunk.model,  
            object="chat.completion",  
        )  
        return base  
      
      
    @mlflow.trace(output_reducer=aggregate_chunks)  
    def predict(messages: list[dict]):  
        client = openai.OpenAI()  
        stream = client.chat.completions.create(  
            model="gpt-4o-mini",  
            messages=messages,  
            stream=True,  
        )  
        for chunk in stream:  
            yield chunk  
      
      
    for chunk in predict([{"role": "user", "content": "Hello"}]):  
        print(chunk)  
    

In the example above, the generated `predict` span will have a single chat completion message as the output, which is aggregated by the custom reducer function.

### Real-world use casesâ

Here are additional examples of output reducers for common GenAI scenarios:

#### LLM response with JSON parsingâ

Python
    
    
    from typing import List, Dict, Any  
    import json  
      
    def parse_json_from_llm(content: str) -> str:  
        """Extract and clean JSON from LLM responses that may include markdown"""  
        # Remove common markdown code block wrappers  
        if content.startswith("```json") and content.endswith("```"):  
            content = content[7:-3]  # Remove ```json prefix and ``` suffix  
        elif content.startswith("```") and content.endswith("```"):  
            content = content[3:-3]  # Remove generic ``` wrappers  
        return content.strip()  
      
    def json_stream_reducer(chunks: List[Dict[str, Any]]) -> Dict[str, Any]:  
        """Aggregate LLM streaming output and parse JSON response"""

#### Structured output generation with OpenAIâ

Here's a complete example of using output reducers with OpenAI to generate and parse structured JSON responses:

Python
    
    
    import json  
    import mlflow  
    import openai

            "model": model_info,

        }

                        "content": chunk.choices[0].delta.content  
                    }  
      
            # Add trace metadata  
            if current_span := mlflow.get_current_active_span():  
                yield {  
                    "type": "trace_info",

            # In practice, you might send these chunks to a frontend  
            print(chunk.get("content", ""), end="", flush=True)  
    

Integration Benefits

This example showcases several real-world patterns:

  * **Streaming UI updates** : Tokens can be displayed as they arrive
  * **Structured output validation** : JSON parsing ensures response format
  * **Error resilience** : Handles API errors and parsing failures gracefully
  * **Trace correlation** : Links streaming output to MLflow traces for debugging



#### Multi-model response aggregationâ

Python
    
    
    def multi_model_reducer(chunks: List[Dict[str, Any]]) -> Dict[str, Any]:  
        """Aggregate responses from multiple models"""  
        responses = {}  
        latencies = {}  
      
        for chunk in chunks:  
            model = chunk.get("model")  
            if model:  
                responses[model] = chunk.get("response", "")  
                latencies[model] = chunk.get("latency", 0)  
      
        return {  
            "responses": responses,  
            "latencies": latencies,  
            "fastest_model": min(latencies, key=latencies.get) if latencies else None,  
            "consensus": len(set(responses.values())) == 1  
        }  
    

### Testing output reducersâ

Output reducers can be tested independently of the tracing framework, making it easy to ensure they handle edge cases correctly:

Python
    
    
    import unittest  
    from typing import List, Dict, Any  
      
    def my_reducer(chunks: List[Dict[str, Any]]) -> Dict[str, Any]:  
        """Example reducer to be tested"""  
        if not chunks:  
            return {"status": "empty", "total": 0}  
      
        total = sum(c.get("value", 0) for c in chunks)  
        errors = [c for c in chunks if c.get("error")]  
      
        return {  
            "status": "error" if errors else "success",  
            "total": total,  
            "count": len(chunks),  
            "average": total / len(chunks) if chunks else 0,  
            "error_count": len(errors)  
        }  
      
    class TestOutputReducer(unittest.TestCase):  
        def test_normal_case(self):  
            chunks = [  
                {"value": 10},  
                {"value": 20},  
                {"value": 30}  
            ]  
            result = my_reducer(chunks)  
            self.assertEqual(result["status"], "success")  
            self.assertEqual(result["total"], 60)  
            self.assertEqual(result["average"], 20.0)  
      
        def test_empty_input(self):  
            result = my_reducer([])  
            self.assertEqual(result["status"], "empty")  
            self.assertEqual(result["total"], 0)  
      
        def test_error_handling(self):  
            chunks = [  
                {"value": 10},  
                {"error": "Network timeout"},  
                {"value": 20}  
            ]  
            result = my_reducer(chunks)  
            self.assertEqual(result["status"], "error")  
            self.assertEqual(result["total"], 30)  
            self.assertEqual(result["error_count"], 1)  
      
        def test_missing_values(self):  
            chunks = [  
                {"value": 10},  
                {"metadata": "some info"},  # No value field  
                {"value": 20}  
            ]  
            result = my_reducer(chunks)  
            self.assertEqual(result["total"], 30)  
            self.assertEqual(result["count"], 3)  
    

Performance Considerations

  * Output reducers receive all chunks in memory at once. For very large streams, consider implementing streaming alternatives or chunking strategies.
  * The span remains open until the generator is fully consumed, which impacts latency metrics.
  * Reducers should be stateless and avoid side effects for predictable behavior.
