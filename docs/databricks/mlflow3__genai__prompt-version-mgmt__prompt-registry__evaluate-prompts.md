# Evaluate and compare prompt versions

Beta

This feature is in [Beta](</aws/en/release-notes/release-types>). Workspace admins can control access to this feature from the **Previews** page. See [Manage Databricks previews](</aws/en/admin/workspace-settings/manage-previews>).

This guide shows you how to systematically evaluate different prompt versions to identify the most effective ones for your agents and GenAI applications. You'll learn to create prompt versions, build evaluation datasets with expected facts, and use MLflow's evaluation framework to compare performance.

All of the code on this page is included in the example notebook.

## Prerequisitesâ

This guide requires:

  * MLflow 3.1.0 or higher.
  * OpenAI API access or Databricks Model Serving.
  * Unity Catalog schema with `CREATE FUNCTION`, `EXECUTE`, and `MANAGE` privileges.



note

If you are using a [Databricks trial account](</aws/en/getting-started/express-setup>), you have the required permissions on the Unity Catalog schema `workspace.default`.

## Best practicesâ

  1. **Start simple** : Begin with basic prompts and iteratively improve based on evaluation results.
  2. **Use consistent datasets** : Evaluate all versions against the same data for fair comparison.
  3. **Track everything** : Log prompt versions, evaluation results, and deployment decisions.
  4. **Test edge cases** : Include challenging examples in your evaluation dataset.
  5. **Monitor production** : Continue evaluating prompts after deployment to catch degradation.
  6. **Document changes** : Use meaningful commit messages to track why changes were made.



## Step 1: Configure your environmentâ

note

You need `CREATE FUNCTION`, `EXECUTE`, and `MANAGE` privileges on both the catalog and schema to create prompts and evaluation datasets.

First, set up your Unity Catalog schema and install required packages:

Python
    
    
    # Install required packages  
    %pip install --upgrade "mlflow[databricks]>=3.1.0" openai  
    dbutils.library.restartPython()  
      
    # Configure your Unity Catalog schema  
    import mlflow  
    import pandas as pd  
    from openai import OpenAI  
    import uuid  
      
    CATALOG = "main"        # Replace with your catalog name  
    SCHEMA = "default"      # Replace with your schema name  
      
    # Create unique names for the prompt and dataset  
    SUFFIX = uuid.uuid4().hex[:8]  # Short unique suffix  
    PROMPT_NAME = f"{CATALOG}.{SCHEMA}.summary_prompt_{SUFFIX}"  
    EVAL_DATASET_NAME = f"{CATALOG}.{SCHEMA}.summary_eval_{SUFFIX}"  
      
    print(f"Prompt name: {PROMPT_NAME}")  
    print(f"Evaluation dataset: {EVAL_DATASET_NAME}")  
      
    # Set up OpenAI client  
    client = OpenAI()  
    

## Step 2: Create prompt versionsâ

Register different prompt versions representing different approaches to your task:

Python
    
    
    # Version 1: Basic prompt  
    prompt_v1 = mlflow.genai.register_prompt(  
        name=PROMPT_NAME,  
        template="Summarize this text: {{content}}",  
        commit_message="v1: Basic summarization prompt"  
    )  
      
    print(f"Created prompt version {prompt_v1.version}")  
      
    # Version 2: Improved with comprehensive guidelines  
    prompt_v2 = mlflow.genai.register_prompt(  
        name=PROMPT_NAME,  
        template="""You are an expert summarizer. Create a summary of the following content in *exactly* 2 sentences (no more, no less - be very careful about the number of sentences).  
      
    Guidelines:  
    - Include ALL core facts and key findings  
    - Use clear, concise language  
    - Maintain factual accuracy  
    - Cover all main points mentioned  
    - Write for a general audience  
    - Use exactly 2 sentences  
      
    Content: {{content}}  
      
    Summary:""",  
        commit_message="v2: Added comprehensive fact coverage with 2-sentence requirement"  
    )  
      
    print(f"Created prompt version {prompt_v2.version}")  
    

## Step 3: Create evaluation datasetâ

Build a dataset with expected facts that should appear in good summaries:

Python
    
    
    # Create evaluation dataset  
    eval_dataset = mlflow.genai.datasets.create_dataset(  
        uc_table_name=EVAL_DATASET_NAME  
    )  
      
    # Add summarization examples with expected facts  
    evaluation_examples = [  
        {  
            "inputs": {  
                "content": """Remote work has fundamentally changed how teams collaborate and communicate. Companies have adopted new digital tools for video conferencing, project management, and file sharing. While productivity has remained stable or increased in many cases, challenges include maintaining company culture, ensuring work-life balance, and managing distributed teams across time zones. The shift has also accelerated digital transformation initiatives and changed hiring practices, with many companies now recruiting talent globally rather than locally."""  
            },  
            "expectations": {  
                "expected_facts": [  
                    "remote work changed collaboration",  
                    "digital tools adoption",  
                    "productivity remained stable",  
                    "challenges with company culture",  
                    "work-life balance issues",  
                    "global talent recruitment"  
                ]  
            }  
        },  
        {  
            "inputs": {  
                "content": """Electric vehicles are gaining mainstream adoption as battery technology improves and charging infrastructure expands. Major automakers have committed to electrification with new models launching regularly. Government incentives and environmental regulations are driving consumer interest. However, challenges remain including higher upfront costs, limited charging stations in rural areas, and concerns about battery life and replacement costs. The market is expected to grow significantly over the next decade."""  
            },  
            "expectations": {  
                "expected_facts": [  
                    "electric vehicles gaining adoption",  
                    "battery technology improving",  
                    "charging infrastructure expanding",  
                    "government incentives",  
                    "higher upfront costs",  
                    "limited rural charging",  
                    "market growth expected"  
                ]  
            }  
        },  
        {  
            "inputs": {  
                "content": """Artificial intelligence is transforming healthcare through diagnostic imaging, drug discovery, and personalized treatment plans.

            },  
            "expectations": {  
                "expected_facts": [  
                    "AI transforming healthcare",  
                    "diagnostic imaging improvements",  
                    "drug discovery acceleration",  
                    "personalized treatment",  
                    "earlier disease detection",  
                    "data privacy concerns",  
                    "algorithm bias issues",  
                    "regulatory oversight needed"  
                ]  
            }  
        }  
    ]  
      
    eval_dataset = eval_dataset.merge_records(evaluation_examples)  
    print(f"Added {len(evaluation_examples)} summarization examples to evaluation dataset")  
    

## Step 4: Create evaluation functions and custom metricsâ

Define functions that use your prompt versions and create custom evaluation metrics:

Python
    
    
    def create_summary_function(prompt_name: str, version: int):  
        """Create a summarization function for a specific prompt version."""  
      
        @mlflow.trace  
        def summarize_content(content: str) -> dict:  
            # Load the prompt version  
            prompt = mlflow.genai.load_prompt(  
                name_or_uri=f"prompts:/{prompt_name}/{version}"  
            )  
      
            # Format and call the LLM  
            formatted_prompt = prompt.format(content=content)  
      
            response = client.chat.completions.create(  
                model="gpt-4o-mini",  
                messages=[{"role": "user", "content": formatted_prompt}],  
                temperature=0.1  
            )  
      
            return {"summary": response.choices[0].message.content}  
      
        return summarize_content  
    

### Create a judge with a custom promptâ

Create a [judge](</aws/en/mlflow3/genai/eval-monitor/concepts/scorers>) with a custom prompt to evaluate specific criteria using [`make_judge`](<https://mlflow.org/docs/latest/api_reference/python_api/mlflow.genai.html#mlflow.genai.make_judge>):

Python
    
    
    from typing import Literal  
    from mlflow.genai import make_judge  
      
    # Create a custom judge using make_judge  
    sentence_count_judge = make_judge(  
        name="sentence_count_compliance",  
        instructions="""Evaluate if this summary follows the 2-sentence requirement.  
      
    Summary: {{ outputs }}  
      
    Count the sentences carefully and determine if the summary has exactly 2 sentences.""",  
        feedback_value_type=Literal["correct", "incorrect"],  
    )  
    

## Step 5: Run comparative evaluationâ

Evaluate each prompt version using both built-in and custom scorers:

Python
    
    
    from mlflow.genai.scorers import Correctness  
      
    # Define scorers  
    scorers = [  
        Correctness(),  # Checks expected facts  
        sentence_count_judge,  # Custom sentence count judge  
    ]  
      
    # Evaluate each version  
    results = {}  
      
    for version in [1, 2]:  
        print(f"\nEvaluating version {version}...")  
      
        with mlflow.start_run(run_name=f"summary_v{version}_eval"):  
            mlflow.log_param("prompt_version", version)  
      
            # Run evaluation  
            eval_results = mlflow.genai.evaluate(  
                predict_fn=create_summary_function(PROMPT_NAME, version),  
                data=eval_dataset,  
                scorers=scorers,  
            )  
      
            results[f"v{version}"] = eval_results  
            print(f"  Correctness score: {eval_results.metrics.get('correctness/mean', 0):.2f}")  
            print(f"  Sentence compliance: {eval_results.metrics.get('sentence_count_compliance/mean', 0):.2f}")  
    

## Step 6: Compare results and select best versionâ

Analyze the results to identify the best performing prompt:

Python
    
    
    # Compare versions across all metrics  
    print("=== Version Comparison ===")  
    for version, result in results.items():  
        correctness_score = result.metrics.get('correctness/mean', 0)  
        compliance_score = result.metrics.get('sentence_count_compliance/mean', 0)  
        print(f"{version}:")  
        print(f"  Correctness: {correctness_score:.2f}")  
        print(f"  Sentence compliance: {compliance_score:.2f}")  
        print()  
      
    # Calculate composite scores  
    print("=== Composite Scores ===")  
    composite_scores = {}  
    for version, result in results.items():  
        correctness = result.metrics.get('correctness/mean', 0)  
        compliance = result.metrics.get('sentence_count_compliance/mean', 0)  
        # Weight correctness more heavily (70%) than compliance (30%)  
        composite = 0.7 * correctness + 0.3 * compliance  
        composite_scores[version] = composite  
        print(f"{version}: {composite:.2f}")  
      
    # Find best version  
    best_version = max(composite_scores.items(), key=lambda x: x[1])  
    print(f"\nBest performing version: {best_version[0]} (score: {best_version[1]:.2f})")  
      
    # Show why this version is best  
    best_results = results[best_version[0]]  
    print(f"\nWhy {best_version[0]} is best:")  
    print(f"- Captures {best_results.metrics.get('correctness/mean', 0):.0%} of expected facts")  
    print(f"- Follows sentence requirements {best_results.metrics.get('sentence_count_compliance/mean', 0):.0%} of the time")  
    

After identifying the best performing prompt version through evaluation, you're ready to deploy it. To learn how to use aliases for production deployment, see [Use prompts in deployed apps](</aws/en/mlflow3/genai/prompt-version-mgmt/prompt-registry/use-prompts-in-deployed-apps>).
