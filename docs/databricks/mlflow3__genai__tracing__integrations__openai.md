# Tracing OpenAI

[MLflow Tracing](</aws/en/mlflow3/genai/tracing/>) provides automatic tracing capability for OpenAI. By enabling auto tracing for OpenAI by calling the [`mlflow.openai.autolog`](<https://mlflow.org/docs/latest/api_reference/python_api/mlflow.openai.html#mlflow.openai.autolog>) function, MLflow will capture traces for LLM invocation and log them to the active MLflow Experiment.

MLflow trace automatically captures the following information about OpenAI calls:

  * Prompts and completion responses
  * Latencies
  * Model name
  * Additional metadata such as `temperature`, `max_tokens`, if specified.
  * Function calling if returned in the response
  * Any exception if raised



## Prerequisitesâ

To use MLflow Tracing with OpenAI, you need to install MLflow and the OpenAI SDK.

  * Development
  * Production



For development environments, install the full MLflow package with Databricks extras and `openai`:

Bash
    
    
    pip install --upgrade "mlflow[databricks]>=3.1" openai  
    

The full `mlflow[databricks]` package includes all features for local development and experimentation on Databricks.

For production deployments, install `mlflow-tracing` and `openai`:

Bash
    
    
    pip install --upgrade mlflow-tracing openai  
    

The `mlflow-tracing` package is optimized for production use.

note

MLflow 3 is highly recommended for the best tracing experience with OpenAI.

Before running the examples, you'll need to configure your environment:

**For users outside Databricks notebooks** : Set your Databricks environment variables:

Bash
    
    
    export DATABRICKS_HOST="https://your-workspace.cloud.databricks.com"  
    export DATABRICKS_TOKEN="your-personal-access-token"  
    

**For users inside Databricks notebooks** : These credentials are automatically set for you.

**API Keys** : Ensure your OpenAI API key is configured. For production environments, use [Mosaic AI Gateway or Databricks secrets](</aws/en/mlflow3/genai/tracing/integrations/#secure-api-key-management>) instead of hardcoded values for secure API key management.:

Bash
    
    
    export OPENAI_API_KEY="your-openai-api-key"  
    

## Supported APIsâ

MLflow supports automatic tracing for the following OpenAI APIs:

Chat Completion| Embeddings| Function Calling| Structured Outputs| Streaming| Async| Image| Audio| â | â | â | â (*1)| â (*2)| â (*1)| 

  * 
| 

  * 
  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
  
(*1) Streaming support was added in MLflow 2.15.0.

(*2) Async and structured output supported were added in MLflow 2.21.0.

To request support for additional APIs, please open a [feature request](<https://github.com/mlflow/mlflow/issues>) on GitHub.

## Basic Exampleâ

note

On serverless compute clusters, autologging for genAI tracing frameworks is not automatically enabled. You must explicitly enable autologging by calling the appropriate `mlflow.<library>.autolog()` function for the specific integrations you want to trace.

Python
    
    
    import openai  
    import mlflow  
    import os  
      
    # Ensure your OPENAI_API_KEY is set in your environment  
    # os.environ["OPENAI_API_KEY"] = "your-openai-api-key" # Uncomment and set if not globally configured  
      
    # Enable auto-tracing for OpenAI  
    mlflow.openai.autolog()  
      
    # Set up MLflow tracking to Databricks  
    mlflow.set_tracking_uri("databricks")  
    mlflow.set_experiment("/Shared/openai-tracing-demo")  
      
    openai_client = openai.OpenAI()  
      
    messages = [  
        {  
            "role": "user",  
            "content": "What is the capital of France?",  
        }  
    ]  
      
    response = openai_client.chat.completions.create(  
        model="gpt-4o-mini",  
        messages=messages,  
        temperature=0.1,  
        max_tokens=100,  
    )  
    

warning

For production environments, use [Mosaic AI Gateway or Databricks secrets](</aws/en/mlflow3/genai/tracing/integrations/#secure-api-key-management>) instead of hardcoded values for secure API key management.

### OpenAI Example with Secretsâ

Once your secret is stored, use it in your MLflow tracing code:

Python
    
    
    import openai  
    import mlflow  
    import os  
      
    # Configure your secret scope and key names  
    secret_scope_name = "openai-secrets"  
    secret_key_name = "api-key"  
      
    # Retrieve the API key from Databricks secrets  
    os.environ["OPENAI_API_KEY"] = dbutils.secrets.get(  
        scope=secret_scope_name,  
        key=secret_key_name  
    )  
      
    # Verify the API key was loaded successfully  
    assert os.environ["OPENAI_API_KEY"] is not None, "API key not loaded from secrets"  
      
    # Enable auto-tracing for OpenAI  
    mlflow.openai.autolog()  
      
    # Set up MLflow tracking to Databricks  
    mlflow.set_tracking_uri("databricks")  
    mlflow.set_experiment("/Shared/openai-tracing-demo")  
      
    # Now you can use OpenAI as usual  
    openai_client = openai.OpenAI()  
      
    messages = [  
        {  
            "role": "user",  
            "content": "What is the capital of France?",  
        }  
    ]  
      
    response = openai_client.chat.completions.create(  
        model="gpt-4o-mini",  
        messages=messages,  
        temperature=0.1,  
        max_tokens=100,  
    )  
    

## Streamingâ

MLflow Tracing supports streaming API of the OpenAI SDK. With the same set up of auto tracing, MLflow automatically traces the streaming response and render the concatenated output in the span UI. The actual chunks in the response stream can be found in the `Event` tab as well.

Python
    
    
    import openai  
    import mlflow  
    import os  
      
    # Ensure your OPENAI_API_KEY is set in your environment  
    # os.environ["OPENAI_API_KEY"] = "your-openai-api-key" # Uncomment and set if not globally configured  
      
    # Enable trace logging  
    mlflow.openai.autolog()  
      
    # Set up MLflow tracking to Databricks if not already configured  
    # mlflow.set_tracking_uri("databricks")  
    # mlflow.set_experiment("/Shared/openai-streaming-demo")  
      
    client = openai.OpenAI()  
      
    stream = client.chat.completions.create(  
        model="gpt-4o-mini",  
        messages=[  
            {"role": "user", "content": "How fast would a glass of water freeze on Titan?"}  
        ],  
        stream=True,  # Enable streaming response  
    )  
    for chunk in stream:  
        print(chunk.choices[0].delta.content or "", end="")  
    

## Asyncâ

MLflow Tracing supports asynchronous API of the OpenAI SDK since MLflow 2.21.0. The usage is same as the synchronous API.

Python
    
    
    import openai  
    import mlflow  
    import os  
      
    # Ensure your OPENAI_API_KEY is set in your environment  
    # os.environ["OPENAI_API_KEY"] = "your-openai-api-key" # Uncomment and set if not globally configured  
      
    # Enable trace logging  
    mlflow.openai.autolog()  
      
    # Set up MLflow tracking to Databricks if not already configured  
    # mlflow.set_tracking_uri("databricks")  
    # mlflow.set_experiment("/Shared/openai-async-demo")  
      
    client = openai.AsyncOpenAI()  
      
    response = await client.chat.completions.create(  
        model="gpt-4o-mini",  
        messages=[  
            {"role": "user", "content": "How fast would a glass of water freeze on Titan?"}  
        ],  
        # Async streaming is also supported  
        # stream=True  
    )  
    

## Function Callingâ

MLflow Tracing automatically captures function calling response from OpenAI models. The function instruction in the response will be highlighted in the trace UI. Moreover, you can annotate the tool function with the `@mlflow.trace` decorator to create a span for the tool execution.

The following example implements a simple function calling agent using OpenAI Function Calling and MLflow Tracing for OpenAI.

Python
    
    
    import json  
    from openai import OpenAI  
    import mlflow  
    from mlflow.entities import SpanType  
    import os  
      
    # Ensure your OPENAI_API_KEY is set in your environment  
    # os.environ["OPENAI_API_KEY"] = "your-openai-api-key" # Uncomment and set if not globally configured  
      
    # Set up MLflow tracking to Databricks if not already configured  
    # mlflow.set_tracking_uri("databricks")  
    # mlflow.set_experiment("/Shared/openai-function-agent-demo")  
      
    # Assuming autolog is enabled globally or called earlier  
    # mlflow.openai.autolog()  
      
    client = OpenAI()  
      
      
    # Define the tool function. Decorate it with `@mlflow.trace` to create a span for its execution.  
    @mlflow.trace(span_type=SpanType.TOOL)  
    def get_weather(city: str) -> str:  
        if city == "Tokyo":  
            return "sunny"  
        elif city == "Paris":  
            return "rainy"  
        return "unknown"  
      
      
    tools = [  
        {  
            "type": "function",  
            "function": {  
                "name": "get_weather",  
                "parameters": {  
                    "type": "object",  
                    "properties": {"city": {"type": "string"}},  
                },  
            },  
        }  
    ]  
      
    _tool_functions = {"get_weather": get_weather}  
      
      
    # Define a simple tool calling agent  
    @mlflow.trace(span_type=SpanType.AGENT)  
    def run_tool_agent(question: str):  
        messages = [{"role": "user", "content": question}]  
      
        # Invoke the model with the given question and available tools  
        response = client.chat.completions.create(  
            model="gpt-4o-mini",  
            messages=messages,  
            tools=tools,  
        )  
        ai_msg = response.choices[0].message  
        messages.append(ai_msg)  
      
        # If the model request tool call(s), invoke the function with the specified arguments  
        if tool_calls := ai_msg.tool_calls:  
            for tool_call in tool_calls:  
                function_name = tool_call.function.name  
                if tool_func := _tool_functions.get(function_name):  
                    args = json.loads(tool_call.function.arguments)  
                    tool_result = tool_func(**args)  
                else:  
                    raise RuntimeError("An invalid tool is returned from the assistant!")  
      
                messages.append(  
                    {  
                        "role": "tool",  
                        "tool_call_id": tool_call.id,  
                        "content": tool_result,  
                    }  
                )  
      
            # Sent the tool results to the model and get a new response  
            response = client.chat.completions.create(  
                model="gpt-4o-mini", messages=messages  
            )  
      
        return response.choices[0].message.content  
      
      
    # Run the tool calling agent  
    question = "What's the weather like in Paris today?"  
    answer = run_tool_agent(question)  
    

## Disable auto-tracingâ

Auto tracing for OpenAI can be disabled globally by calling `mlflow.openai.autolog(disable=True)` or `mlflow.autolog(disable=True)`.
