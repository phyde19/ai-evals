# Optimize prompts tutorial

This tutorial example optimizes a simple prompt **classify this query** using MLflow Prompt Optimization using GEPA and GPT-OSS 20B for classification tasks.

## Install dependenciesâ

Python
    
    
    %pip install --upgrade mlflow databricks-sdk dspy openai  
    dbutils.library.restartPython()  
      
    

Ensure that you have access to the Databricks Foundation Model APIs to run this successfully.

Python
    
    
    import mlflow  
    import openai  
    from mlflow.genai.optimize import GepaPromptOptimizer  
    from mlflow.genai.scorers import Correctness  
    from databricks_openai import DatabricksOpenAI  
      
    # Change the catalog and schema to your catalog and schema  
    catalog = ""  
    schema = ""  
    prompt_registry_name = "qa"  
    prompt_location = f"{catalog}.{schema}.{prompt_registry_name}"  
      
    openai_client = DatabricksOpenAI()  
      
    # Register initial prompt  
    prompt = mlflow.genai.register_prompt(  
        name=prompt_location,  
        template="classify this: {{query}}",  
    )  
      
      
    # Define your prediction function  
    def predict_fn(query: str) -> str:  
        prompt = mlflow.genai.load_prompt(f"prompts:/{prompt_location}/1")  
        completion = openai_client.chat.completions.create(  
            model="databricks-gpt-oss-20b",  
            # load prompt template using PromptVersion.format()  
            messages=[{"role": "user", "content": prompt.format(question=query)}],  
        )  
        return completion.choices[0].message.content  
      
      
      
    

## Test your functionâ

Observe how accurately the model can classify the input with a bare bones prompt. While accurate, it's not aligned to any task or use case you're looking for.

Python
    
    
    from IPython.display import Markdown  
      
    output = predict_fn("The emergence of HIV as a chronic condition means that people living with HIV are required to take more responsibility for the self-management of their condition , including making physical , emotional and social adjustments.")  
      
    Markdown(output[1]['text'])  
    

## Optimize against dataâ

Provide data with expected responses and facts to help optimize the model behavior and output in a way that fits your use cases.

In this case, you want the model to output one word from a choice of five words. It should only output that word without any further explanation.

Python
    
    
    # Training data with inputs and expected outputs  
    dataset = [  
        {  
            "inputs": {"query": "The emergence of HIV as a chronic condition means that people living with HIV are required to take more responsibility for the self-management of their condition , including making physical , emotional and social adjustments."},  
            "outputs": {"response": "BACKGROUND"},  
            "expectations": {"expected_facts": ["Classification label must be 'CONCLUSIONS', 'RESULTS', 'METHODS', 'OBJECTIVE', 'BACKGROUND'"]}  
        },  
        {  
            "inputs": {"query": "This paper describes the design and evaluation of Positive Outlook , an online program aiming to enhance the self-management skills of gay men living with HIV ."},  
            "outputs": {"response": "BACKGROUND"},  
            "expectations": {"expected_facts": ["Classification label must be 'CONCLUSIONS', 'RESULTS', 'METHODS', 'OBJECTIVE', 'BACKGROUND'"]}  
        },  
        {  
            "inputs": {"query": "This study is designed as a randomised controlled trial in which men living with HIV in Australia will be assigned to either an intervention group or usual care control group ."},  
            "outputs": {"response": "METHODS"},  
            "expectations": {"expected_facts": ["Classification label must be 'CONCLUSIONS', 'RESULTS', 'METHODS', 'OBJECTIVE', 'BACKGROUND'"]}  
        },  
        {  
            "inputs": {"query": "The intervention group will participate in the online group program ` Positive Outlook ' ."},  
            "outputs": {"response": "METHODS"},  
            "expectations": {"expected_facts": ["Classification label must be 'CONCLUSIONS', 'RESULTS', 'METHODS', 'OBJECTIVE', 'BACKGROUND'"]}  
        },  
        {  
            "inputs": {"query": "The program is based on self-efficacy theory and uses a self-management approach to enhance skills , confidence and abilities to manage the psychosocial issues associated with HIV in daily life ."},  
            "outputs": {"response": "METHODS"},  
            "expectations": {"expected_facts": ["Classification label must be 'CONCLUSIONS', 'RESULTS', 'METHODS', 'OBJECTIVE', 'BACKGROUND'"]}  
        },  
        {  
            "inputs": {"query": "Participants will access the program for a minimum of 90 minutes per week over seven weeks ."},  
            "outputs": {"response": "METHODS"},  
            "expectations": {"expected_facts": ["Classification label must be 'CONCLUSIONS', 'RESULTS', 'METHODS', 'OBJECTIVE', 'BACKGROUND'"]}  
        }  
    ]  
      
    # Optimize the prompt  
    result = mlflow.genai.optimize_prompts(  
        predict_fn=predict_fn,  
        train_data=dataset,  
        prompt_uris=[prompt.uri],  
        optimizer=GepaPromptOptimizer(reflection_model="databricks:/databricks-claude-sonnet-4-5"),  
        scorers=[Correctness(model="databricks:/databricks-gpt-5")],  
    )  
      
    # Use the optimized prompt  
    optimized_prompt = result.optimized_prompts[0]  
    print(f"Optimized template: {optimized_prompt.template}")  
    

## Review your promptâ

Open the link to your MLflow experiment and complete the following steps to have the prompts appear in your experiment:

  1. Ensure your experiment type is set to GenAI apps and agents
  2. Navigate to the prompt tab
  3. Click **select a schema** on the top right and enter the same schema you set above to see your prompt



## Load the new prompt and test againâ

See what the prompt looks like and load it into your predict function to see how differently the model performs.

Python
    
    
    from IPython.display import Markdown  
    prompt = mlflow.genai.load_prompt(f"prompts:/{prompt_location}/34")  
      
    Markdown(prompt.template)  
    

Python
    
    
    from IPython.display import Markdown  
      
    def predict_fn(query: str) -> str:  
        prompt = mlflow.genai.load_prompt(f"prompts:/{prompt_location}/34")  
        completion = openai_client.chat.completions.create(  
            model="databricks-gpt-oss-20b",  
            # load prompt template using PromptVersion.format()  
            messages=[{"role": "user", "content": prompt.format(query=query)}],  
        )  
        return completion.choices[0].message.content  
      
    output = predict_fn("The emergence of HIV as a chronic condition means that people living with HIV are required to take more responsibility for the self-management of their condition , including making physical , emotional and social adjustments.")  
      
    Markdown(output[1]['text'])
