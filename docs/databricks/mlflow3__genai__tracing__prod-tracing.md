# Trace agents deployed on Databricks

This page shows how to deploy GenAI applications on Databricks so that production traces are captured automatically.

For apps deployed outside Databricks, see [Trace agents deployed outside of Databricks](</aws/en/mlflow3/genai/tracing/prod-tracing-external>).

You can deploy GenAI applications on Databricks using [Mosaic AI Agent Framework](</aws/en/generative-ai/agent-framework/build-genai-apps>) (recommended) or custom CPU Model Serving. Regardless of which deployment method you choose, traces are logged to your MLflow experiment for real-time viewing. You can optionally store traces long-term in Delta tables using [Production Monitoring](</aws/en/mlflow3/genai/eval-monitor/production-monitoring>) for durable storage and automated quality assessment.

##  Deploy with Agent Framework (recommended)â

When you deploy GenAI applications using [Mosaic AI Agent Framework](</aws/en/generative-ai/agent-framework/build-genai-apps>), MLflow Tracing works automatically without additional configuration. Traces are stored in the agent's MLflow experiment.

Set up the storage location(s) for traces:

  1. If you plan to use [Production Monitoring](</aws/en/mlflow3/genai/eval-monitor/production-monitoring>) to store traces in Delta tables, then ensure it is enabled for your workspace.
  2. [Create an MLflow Experiment](</aws/en/mlflow/experiments#create-workspace-experiment>) for storing your app's production traces.



Next, in your Python notebook, instrument your agent with MLflow Tracing, and use Agent Framework to deploy your agent:

  1. Install the latest version of `mlflow[databricks]` in your Python environment.
  2. Connect to the MLflow Experiment using [`mlflow.set_experiment(...)`](<https://mlflow.org/docs/latest/api_reference/python_api/mlflow.html#mlflow.set_experiment>).
  3. Wrap your agent code using [MLflow `ResponsesAgent`](</aws/en/generative-ai/agent-framework/author-agent-model-serving>). In your agent code, enable MLflow Tracing using [automatic](</aws/en/mlflow3/genai/tracing/app-instrumentation/automatic>) or [manual](</aws/en/mlflow3/genai/tracing/app-instrumentation/manual-tracing/>) instrumentation.
  4. Log your agent as an MLflow model, and register it to Unity Catalog.
  5. Ensure that `mlflow` is in the model's Python dependencies, with the same package version used in your notebook environment.
  6. Use `agents.deploy(...)` to deploy the Unity Catalog model (agent) to a Model Serving endpoint.



note

If you are deploying an agent from a notebook stored in a [Databricks Git folder](</aws/en/repos/>), MLflow 3 real-time tracing does not work by default.

To enable real-time tracing, set the experiment to a non-Git-associated experiment using [`mlflow.set_experiment()`](<https://mlflow.org/docs/latest/api_reference/python_api/mlflow.html?highlight=set_experiment#mlflow.set_experiment>) before running `agents.deploy()`.

This notebook demonstrates the deployment steps above.

##  Deploy with custom CPU serving (alternative)â

If you can't use Agent Framework, deploy your agent using custom CPU Model Serving instead.

First, set up the storage location(s) for traces:

  1. If you plan to use [Production Monitoring](</aws/en/mlflow3/genai/eval-monitor/production-monitoring>) to store traces in Delta tables, then ensure it is enabled for your workspace.
  2. [Create an MLflow Experiment](</aws/en/mlflow/experiments#create-workspace-experiment>) for storing your app's production traces.



Next, in your Python notebook, instrument your agent with MLflow Tracing, and use the Model Serving UI or APIs to deploy your agent:

  1. Log your agent as an MLflow model with [automatic](</aws/en/mlflow3/genai/tracing/app-instrumentation/automatic>) or [manual](</aws/en/mlflow3/genai/tracing/app-instrumentation/manual-tracing/>) tracing instrumentation.
  2. Deploy the model to CPU serving.
  3. Provision a Service Principal or Personal Access Token (PAT) with `CAN_EDIT` access to the MLflow experiment.
  4. In the CPU serving endpoint page, go to "Edit endpoint." For each deployed model to trace, add the following environment variables:
  5. `ENABLE_MLFLOW_TRACING=true`
  6. `MLFLOW_EXPERIMENT_ID=<ID of the experiment you created>`
  7. If you provisioned a Service Principal, set `DATABRICKS_CLIENT_ID` and `DATABRICKS_CLIENT_SECRET`. If you provisioned a PAT, set `DATABRICKS_HOST` and `DATABRICKS_TOKEN`.



## Trace storageâ

Databricks logs traces to the MLflow experiment that you set with [`mlflow.set_experiment(...)`](<https://mlflow.org/docs/latest/api_reference/python_api/mlflow.html#mlflow.set_experiment>) during deployment. Traces are available for real-time viewing in the MLflow UI.

Traces are stored as artifacts, for which you can specify a custom storage location. For example, if you [create a workspace experiment](</aws/en/mlflow/experiments#create-experiment-from-the-workspace>) with `artifact_location` set to a Unity Catalog volume, then trace data access is governed by [Unity Catalog volume privileges](</aws/en/data-governance/unity-catalog/manage-privileges/privileges#read-volume>).

##  Store traces long-term with Production Monitoringâ

After traces are logged to your MLflow experiment, you can optionally store them long-term in Delta tables using [Production Monitoring](</aws/en/mlflow3/genai/eval-monitor/production-monitoring>) (in beta).

Benefits of Production Monitoring for trace storage:

  * **Durable storage** : Store traces in Delta tables for long-term retention beyond the MLflow experiment artifact lifecycle.
  * **No trace size limits** : Unlike alternative storage methods, Production Monitoring handles traces of any size.
  * **Automated quality assessment** : Run MLflow scorers on production traces to continuously monitor application quality.
  * **Fast sync** : Traces sync to Delta tables approximately every 15 minutes.



note

Alternatively, you can use [AI Gateway-enabled inference tables](</aws/en/ai-gateway/inference-tables>) to store traces. However, be aware of the [limitations](</aws/en/ai-gateway/inference-tables#limitations>) on trace sizes and sync delays.

  * [Production monitoring](</aws/en/mlflow3/genai/eval-monitor/production-monitoring>) \- Store traces in Delta tables for long-term retention and automatically evaluate with scorers.
  * [Add context to traces](</aws/en/mlflow3/genai/tracing/add-context-to-traces>) \- Attach metadata for request tracking, user sessions, and environment data.
