# Tracing CrewAI

[CrewAI](<https://www.crewai.com/>) is an open-source framework for orchestrating role-playing, autonomous AI agent.

[MLflow Tracing](</aws/en/mlflow3/genai/tracing/>) provides automatic tracing capability for [CrewAI](<https://www.crewai.com/>), an open source framework for building multi-agent applications. By enabling auto tracing for CrewAI by calling the [`mlflow.crewai.autolog`](<https://mlflow.org/docs/latest/api_reference/python_api/mlflow.crewai.html#mlflow.crewai.autolog>) function, MLflow will capture nested traces for CrewAI workflow execution and log them to the active MLflow Experiment.

Python
    
    
    import mlflow  
      
    mlflow.crewai.autolog()  
    

note

On serverless compute clusters, autologging for genAI tracing frameworks is not automatically enabled. You must explicitly enable autologging by calling the appropriate `mlflow.<library>.autolog()` function for the specific integrations you want to trace.

MLflow trace automatically captures the following information about CrewAI agents:

  * Tasks and Agent who executes each task
  * Every LLM calls with input prompts, completion responses, and various metadata
  * Memory load and writes operations
  * Latency of each operation
  * Any exception if raised



note

On serverless compute clusters, autologging is not automatically enabled. You must explicitly call `mlflow.crewai.autolog()` to enable automatic tracing for this integration.

note

Currently, MLflow CrewAI integration only support tracing for synchronous task execution. Asynchronous task and kickoff are not supported right now.

## Prerequisitesâ

To use MLflow Tracing with CrewAI, you need to install MLflow and the `crewai` library (which includes `crewai_tools`).

  * Development
  * Production



For development environments, install the full MLflow package with Databricks extras and `crewai`:

Bash
    
    
    pip install --upgrade "mlflow[databricks]>=3.1" crewai  
    

The full `mlflow[databricks]` package includes all features for local development and experimentation on Databricks.

For production deployments, install `mlflow-tracing` and `crewai`:

Bash
    
    
    pip install --upgrade mlflow-tracing crewai  
    

The `mlflow-tracing` package is optimized for production use.

note

MLflow 3 is highly recommended for the best tracing experience with CrewAI.

Before running the examples, you'll need to configure your environment:

**For users outside Databricks notebooks** : Set your Databricks environment variables:

Bash
    
    
    export DATABRICKS_HOST="https://your-workspace.cloud.databricks.com"  
    export DATABRICKS_TOKEN="your-personal-access-token"  
    

**For users inside Databricks notebooks** : These credentials are automatically set for you.

**API Keys** : Ensure any necessary LLM provider API keys are configured. For production use, use [AI Gateway or Databricks secrets](</aws/en/mlflow3/genai/tracing/integrations/#secure-api-key-management>) instead of hardcoded values:

Bash
    
    
    export OPENAI_API_KEY="your-openai-api-key"  
    export SERPER_API_KEY="your-serper-api-key"  
    # Add other provider keys as needed  
    

### Example Usageâ

First, enable auto-tracing for CrewAI, and optionally create an MLflow experiment to write traces to. This helps organizing your traces better.

Python
    
    
    import mlflow  
    import os  
      
    # Ensure your API keys (e.g., OPENAI_API_KEY, SERPER_API_KEY) are set in your environment  
    # os.environ["OPENAI_API_KEY"] = "your-openai-key"  
    # os.environ["SERPER_API_KEY"] = "your-serper-key"  
      
    # Turn on auto tracing by calling mlflow.crewai.autolog()  
    mlflow.crewai.autolog()  
      
      
    # Set up MLflow tracking to Databricks  
    mlflow.set_tracking_uri("databricks")  
    mlflow.set_experiment("/Shared/crewai-demo")  
    

Next, define a multi-agent workflow using CrewAI. The following example defines a trip planner agent that uses web search capability as a tool.

Python
    
    
    from crewai import Agent, Crew, Task  
    from crewai.knowledge.source.string_knowledge_source import StringKnowledgeSource  
    from crewai_tools import SerperDevTool, WebsiteSearchTool  
      
    from textwrap import dedent  
      
    content = "Users name is John. He is 30 years old and lives in San Francisco."  
    string_source = StringKnowledgeSource(  
        content=content, metadata={"preference": "personal"}  
    )  
      
    search_tool = WebsiteSearchTool()  
      
      
    class TripAgents:  
        def city_selection_agent(self):  
            return Agent(  
                role="City Selection Expert",  
                goal="Select the best city based on weather, season, and prices",  
                backstory="An expert in analyzing travel data to pick ideal destinations",  
                tools=[  
                    search_tool,  
                ],  
                verbose=True,  
            )  
      
        def local_expert(self):  
            return Agent(  
                role="Local Expert at this city",  
                goal="Provide the BEST insights about the selected city",  
                backstory="""A knowledgeable local guide with extensive information  
            about the city, it's attractions and customs""",  
                tools=[search_tool],  
                verbose=True,  
            )  
      
      
    class TripTasks:  
        def identify_task(self, agent, origin, cities, interests, range):  
            return Task(  
                description=dedent(

warning

For production environments, use [AI Gateway or Databricks secrets](</aws/en/mlflow3/genai/tracing/integrations/#secure-api-key-management>) instead of hardcoded values or environment variables for secure API key management.

### Disable auto-tracingâ

Auto tracing for CrewAI can be disabled globally by calling `mlflow.crewai.autolog(disable=True)` or `mlflow.autolog(disable=True)`.
